### Hi there 👋

❗ After a period of not being challenged in my previous job I decided to turn my life around and learn how to program.

💥 soon after I started doing some online courses I got hooked to programming and decided I wanted to get good at it and learn as much as I can as soon as possible.

💫 I decided to sign up for the Codaisseur bootcamp where they teach you how to become a full stack developer in just 11 weeks.The following months where challenging but a challenge was exactly what I was looking for and my coding skills where growing at a very fast pace. 

👀 Right now I am looking for a job that can challenge me to keep learning at a high pace.
