### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A couple of months ago I decided to learn how to code. I signed up for the Codaisseur coding academy because they have a strong selection process and high quality teaching. The months after were tough but I managed to finish it. The academy has given me a strong foundation on which I can improve my skills as a developer.

Right now I am looking for a job where I can put my skills to use in projects that are valuable to real people, making software that can do great things. If you are a company that does important work for people and is looking to hire a junior developer, I would love to talk to you!
